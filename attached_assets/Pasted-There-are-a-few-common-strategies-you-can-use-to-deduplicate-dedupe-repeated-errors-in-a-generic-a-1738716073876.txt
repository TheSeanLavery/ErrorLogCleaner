There are a few common strategies you can use to deduplicate (dedupe) repeated errors in a generic and efficient way. The basic idea is to intercept error messages before they’re output and then check if an “equivalent” message has already been logged. If it has, you either suppress the new log or update a counter. Here are some approaches:

---

### 1. **Intercept and Cache Errors**

Override your logging function (for example, wrap or override `console.error`) so that every error goes through a deduplication layer. For each error message, generate a “key” (or fingerprint) that represents the error. Then use a fast lookup structure (like a JavaScript `Map` or plain object) to check if that key has been seen before.

#### Example:
```js
// A simple cache for error messages
const errorCache = new Map();

// A normalization function that strips out variable parts if needed.
// For instance, if numbers or dynamic IDs make messages different,
// you might want to remove or replace them.
function normalizeErrorMessage(message) {
  // This example replaces all digits with a placeholder.
  return message.replace(/\d+/g, '<num>');
}

// Our deduped logger
function dedupedError(message) {
  // Normalize the message so that small dynamic differences don't create distinct keys
  const key = normalizeErrorMessage(message.toString());

  if (errorCache.has(key)) {
    // Increase the counter if the error has already been logged
    errorCache.set(key, errorCache.get(key) + 1);
  } else {
    // If it's new, store it and log it
    errorCache.set(key, 1);
    console.error(message);
  }
}

// Example usage: override the default console.error
console.error = ((origConsoleError) => {
  return function(message, ...args) {
    dedupedError(message);
    // Optionally, if you still want to log the original message once:
    // origConsoleError.apply(console, [message, ...args]);
  };
})(console.error);
```

In this example:

- **Normalization:**  
  The `normalizeErrorMessage` function is crucial if your errors include variable content (like line numbers, unique IDs, etc.). By replacing those with a placeholder, you ensure that messages that are “the same” are keyed identically. You can adjust the regular expression to suit your needs.

- **Caching:**  
  The `errorCache` holds a counter for each unique error. You might decide to later log a summary like “This error occurred 100 more times” or even flush the cache after a certain period.

### 2. **Batching and Periodic Reporting**

If you expect errors to occur in bursts, you can batch them over a short period (say 500 milliseconds or 1 second). During that window, aggregate the errors (using the same fingerprinting technique), and then output a summary after the batch period ends. This approach is especially useful in high-frequency error scenarios (for example, in WebGPU pipelines where a faulty shader might trigger many errors in rapid succession).

#### Pseudo-code Outline:
```js
let errorBatch = new Map();
let batchTimeout = null;

function logErrorBatch() {
  errorBatch.forEach((count, key) => {
    if (count === 1) {
      console.error(key);
    } else {
      console.error(`${key} (occurred ${count} times)`);
    }
  });
  errorBatch.clear();
}

function batchError(message) {
  const key = normalizeErrorMessage(message.toString());
  errorBatch.set(key, (errorBatch.get(key) || 0) + 1);

  if (!batchTimeout) {
    batchTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
      logErrorBatch();
      batchTimeout = null;
    }, 1000); // adjust time window as needed
  }
}
```

In this pattern, errors are collected and then reported as a batch, reducing the overall output noise.

### 3. **Advanced Techniques**

If your error messages have a lot of structure or contain many dynamic parts, you might want to:

- **Parse the error message:** Use a parser or regular expressions to extract the meaningful parts of the error and use those as the key.
- **Use a hash function:** Instead of a simple normalized string, compute a hash (like SHA-1 or a fast non-cryptographic hash) of the normalized message. This can be helpful if the messages are very long.
- **Sliding windows:** To prevent the cache from growing unbounded (if errors stop occurring, you might still hold old keys forever), implement a sliding window or a time-to-live (TTL) for each cached error.

---

### Performance Considerations

- **Data Structure Choice:**  
  Using a `Map` (or object) gives you average-case O(1) lookups which is fast for this purpose.

- **Normalization Overhead:**  
  Make sure that your normalization function is as lightweight as possible. Regular expressions can be expensive if applied to a very high volume of logs, so tune them for your specific error format.

- **Memory Management:**  
  If your application runs for a long time or in a high-error scenario, consider purging old entries from your error cache either periodically or based on a TTL.

---

### Conclusion

By intercepting your logging function and using a simple cache keyed on a normalized version of your error messages, you can programmatically dedupe repeated errors. This approach is generic (works for any error string) and fast (using hash map lookups). Depending on your exact needs, you can further refine the normalization and add batching or TTL logic. This strategy helps reduce console spam and makes it easier to focus on unique errors.
